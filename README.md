# Project1

Project Ceated by Anshul Prasad(ap1770) and Stepen Fu(svf13)

# Testing Strategy

We tested the program with multiple files that each were different. For example, to test a file that is larger than the number of bytes read, we literaly copied a part of the notes section on the project description. To test against white space, we had files that had multiple white space chars in between words. For part 2, we tested the program with multiple nested directories when given both reletive paths and absolute paths. Errror cases were also tested
